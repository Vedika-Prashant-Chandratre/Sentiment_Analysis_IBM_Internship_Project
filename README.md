# Sentiment_Analysis_IBM_Internship_Project
With the increasing volume of user-generated content online, understanding public sentiment has become essential for decision-making. This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques. The goal is to preprocess text data and optimize a Logistic Regression model for accurate sentiment prediction.
